# mirror-manager

Hi, this is my first python project, based on what I usually do, this tool makes it easy for us to mirror repos, currently the existing feature only does remote mirroring based on a web server with flask, to setup a local repository you still have to prepare a web server and do symlinks manually.

### Step

1. Install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the flask
```
python3 main.py
```
